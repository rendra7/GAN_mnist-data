# GAN_mnist-data

In this project, I developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic images, demonstrating proficiency in deep learning and generative modeling. The GAN consists of a generator that creates realistic images and a discriminator that distinguishes real images from synthetic ones. The two networks are trained adversarially to improve each other's performance. Initially, I utilized the MNIST dataset to generate handwritten digit images, achieving realistic outputs. This project showcases my understanding of neural network design, adversarial training, and model convergence.
